# **App Name**: EngVision

## Core Features:

- Interactive Dashboard: Interactive dashboard to display resource allocation in real-time, using data from projects, tasks, and users.
- Workload Heatmap: Workload heatmap showing daily/weekly workload, color-coded by load level (green, yellow, red), and filterable by team and date range.
- Task Management & Gantt Chart: Task management and Gantt chart interface for collaborative scheduling using drag-and-drop. Allow users to draw dependency lines between tasks.
- Alerts & Notifications: Proactively notify users via email of resource conflicts (overloaded engineers) using Python code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background is black.
- Some cards and designs can be dark grey.
- Fonts and buttons and special features should be gradient green, light/med/dark green, white
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern and neutral feel. Easy on the eyes.
- Use clean, minimalist icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons to represent different task types, teams, and project statuses.
- Use a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure the application is accessible on different screen sizes. Dashboard should be modular, allowing users to customize widgets.
- Subtle transitions and animations on data updates and task assignments. Use animation to highlight changes, not distract the user.
